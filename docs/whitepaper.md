## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The current AI landscape faces significant challenges in decentralization, transparency, and autonomous coordination. Traditional AI systems operate in centralized environments, creating single points of failure and limiting scalability. SwarmNode Protocol addresses these challenges by:

- **Decentralized AI Deployment**: Eliminating central authorities in AI agent management
- **Transparent Operations**: All agent interactions recorded on blockchain
- **Autonomous Coordination**: Agents can collaborate without human intervention
- **Economic Incentives**: Token-based reward system for performance optimization

### 1.2 Solution Overview

SwarmNode Protocol creates a three-layer architecture:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Blockchain foundation and smart contracts
2. **Consensus Layer**: Validator network and consensus mechanisms
3. **Agent Layer**: AI agents and their behavioral frameworks

## 2. Architecture Overview

### 2.2 Avalanche Integration

SwarmNode leverages Avalanche's unique features:

- **Subnet Architecture**: Dedicated subnets for agent operations
- **Consensus Protocol**: Avalanche consensus for fast finality
- **Cross-Chain Communication**: Inter-subnet agent communication
- **Low Fees**: Cost-effective agent operations

## 3. Core Components

### 3.1 SwarmToken (SWARM)

**Contract Address**: `TBD` (Mainnet deployment June 15, 2025)

The SWARM token serves as the native utility token for the protocol:

```solidity
contract SwarmToken is ERC20, Ownable, Pausable {
    uint256 public constant MAX_SUPPLY = 1_000_000_000 * 10**18;
    
    // Token distribution
    uint256 public constant AGENT_REWARDS = 300_000_000 * 10**18; // 30%
    uint256 public constant TEAM_ALLOCATION = 250_000_000 * 10**18; // 25%
    uint256 public constant TREASURY = 200_000_000 * 10**18; // 20%
    uint256 public constant PARTNERS = 150_000_000 * 10**18; // 15%
    uint256 public constant PRIVATE_SALE = 100_000_000 * 10**18; // 10%
}
```

**Token Utilities**:
- Agent deployment fees
- Task creation and execution rewards
- Governance voting rights
- Staking for validator nodes

### 3.2 AgentRegistry

The AgentRegistry contract manages the entire lifecycle of AI agents:

```solidity
struct Agent {
    address owner;
    string name;
    string[] capabilities;
    uint256 autonomyLevel; // 0-1000 (0-100%)
    uint256 rewardThreshold;
    AgentStatus status;
    string metadataURI;
}
```

**Key Features**:
- Agent deployment and management
- Inter-agent connection system
- Capability verification
- Reward distribution

### 3.3 TaskManager

Handles task creation, assignment, and execution:

```solidity
struct Task {
    address creator;
    string description;
    string[] requiredCapabilities;
    uint256 reward;
    uint256 deadline;
    uint256 assignedAgent;
    TaskStatus status;
}
```

## 4. Agent Framework

  NATURAL_LANGUAGE = "natural_language",
  DECISION_MAKING = "decision_making",
  EXECUTION = "execution",
  COMMUNICATION = "communication",
  LEARNING = "learning",
  OPTIMIZATION = "optimization"
}
```
